First, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Professor Clark Verbrugge.
The work would not have been possible without his support and advice, especially
during a global pandemic. Secondly, I would like to thank Professor
Laurie Hendren for her guidance in the field of compiler design in my early days
as an undergraduate student. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues and
friends, especially my Sable lab mates, for their encouragement throughout the
entire thesis journey.
