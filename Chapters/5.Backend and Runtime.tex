\chapter{Backend and Runtime}
\label{chapter:backend-and-runtime}

This chapter discusses the last component of the SableWasm compilation pipeline:
the code generation backend and runtime support for generated shared libraries.
Currently, SableWasm has only one backend based on the LLVM compiler
infrastructure. However, in the future, one can easily extend the system by
adding more backends that lower SableWasm MIR into other target languages.
Another problem that appears when designing a backend is how SableWasm MIR
entities map to native constructs. In SableWasm, we take an instance-based
approach. The SableWasm runtime library will manage all entities in an instance
object. The system will pass it to the generated native functions as the first
argument, similar to `this' pointer in many C++ implementations. In the rest of
this chapter, we will first go through the design of the instance object,
followed by the implementation of WebAssembly entities. Finally, we will
discuss the code generation strategies used when lowering SableWasm MIR to LLVM
intermediate representation and the interaction between generated shared
libraries and the hosting language.
