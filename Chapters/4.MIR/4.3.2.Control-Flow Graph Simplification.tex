\subsection{Control-Flow Graph Simplification}

In section 4.2, we illustrated the translation rule from WebAssembly bytecode to
SableWasm MIR. Unfortunately, the translation rules yield suboptimal control
flow graphs. Hence, in this section, we will incrementally improve the control
flow graphs by fixing several obvious issues we found, such as trivial $\phi$
nodes and unnecessary branching. The control flow graph simplification also
performs \emph{dead code elimination} and \emph{unreachable basic block
    elimination}. This section presents the patterns, along with their
transforming strategies used in SableWasm. The general design of the
simplification pass is similar to what one would expect in a peephole optimizer
\cite{peephole-opt}. It iterates through the control flow graph, scans for
matched patterns, and if it finds any optimization opportunities it will apply
transformation strategies immediately. In the future, one may generalize this
simplification pass into a fully-featured peephole optimizer.Using a
domain-specific language for patterns similar to Alive
\cite{alive, alive-in-lean} for LLVM to ensure extensibility and correctness of
the patterns. The simplification pass will terminate once the execution reaches
a fixed point, where there are no more optimization opportunities.

\paragraph{Trivial $\phi$ nodes}
The first pattern we found in generated SableWasm MIR is the trivial $\phi$
nodes. Trivial $\phi$ nodes refer to the $\phi$ nodes with only one candidate
value. In section 4.2.1, we present the translation patterns for \texttt{loop}
instructions in WebAssembly and mentioned that the pattern is suboptimal and
will result in trivial $\phi$ nodes. A quick reminder, the \texttt{loop}
instruction needs to insert $\phi$ nodes to the landing BB, which necessarily
has non-merging control flow as an effect of a limitation in our translation
framework. To address this, we search for \texttt{\%t0 = phi t [\%t1, \%path]}
for all possible type $t$. The transformation strategy is to replace all
appearances of value \texttt{\%t0} with value \texttt{\%t1}. As the $\phi$ nodes
do not map to any operations and are only introduced by SSA to explicitly mark
value merging, removing them from the control flow graph does not change the
semantics of the program. When replacing the values, SableWasm uses the use-site
lists managed by the \texttt{ASTNode} to boost the performance.

\paragraph{Redundant branching}
The second pattern focus on redundant branching. Redundant branching can also
come from the translation patterns for structured control flow. One may already
notice that we will always generate a landing basic block for the instruction
for every structured control flow construct. However, when the control flow
constructs are the last instructions in their enclosing expression, the landing
basic blocks will only contain a single branching instruction.
Figure~\ref{fig:simplify-example} demonstrates an unoptimized example. On the
right-hand side, the WebAssembly function is a simple function that returns one
when the operand is an even number and zero otherwise. On the left-hand side is
its corresponding SableWasm MIR before simplification. Clearly, \texttt{\%BB:0}
and \texttt{\%BB:1} are redundant. The redundant branch elimination pattern
looks for basic blocks with a single inward flow and attempts to merge them
with their predecessors. In the example, the optimizer will try to merge
\texttt{\%BB:1} and \texttt{\%BB:4} by moving the \texttt{Constant} instruction
into \texttt{\%BB:1}, and redirecting the branching in \texttt{\%BB:1} from
\texttt{\%BB:4} to \texttt{\%exit}.

\paragraph{Dead basic block}
The third pattern we have in SableWasm to simplify control flow graph is dead
basic block elimination. In figure~\ref{fig:simplify-example}, we have a dead
basic block, namely \texttt{\%BB:2}. These dead basic blocks again come from
SableWasm's translation patterns. When we are translating the control flow
constructs, we always prepare the landing basic block. However, in many cases,
the control flow may not reach the landing basic block. In the example above,
we have a WebAssembly \texttt{return} instruction appear in the \texttt{block}'s
nested expression. The translation patterns for \texttt{return} instruction is
naive, which creates a branch to the exiting block and configures the $\phi$
nodes accordingly. Hence, in this case, the landing basic block will never have
an inward flow. In SableWasm MIR, we do not consider these unreachable basic
blocks malformed. However, in many backends, these are considered bad behaviour.
In addition, these basic blocks also interfere with other optimizations. In the
example in figure~\ref{fig:simplify-example}, \texttt{\%BB:3} does not satisfy
the redundant branching elimination pattern because it does not have a unique
inward flow. However, one of them, \texttt{\%BB:2}, is a dead block. Thus, by
removing dead basic blocks from the control flow graph, we may find more
optimization opportunities. In SableWasm, we identify the dead basic block via
a mark-and-sweep algorithm. Starting from the entry block, we mark all the basic
blocks that are reachable. Then we iterate overall basic blocks, and if the
basic block does not have the flag, we add them to the delete list. Finally, we
remove all the basic blocks within the delete list from the control flow graph.

        basicstyle=\linespread{0.7}\small\ttfamily,
        language=SableWasmMIR,numbers=left
    ]{Code/4.MIR/simplify-cfg-result.mir}
    \caption{Control-flow graph simplification result}
    \label{fig:simplify-result}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Dead value}
The last pattern we have in the control flow graph simplification pass is dead
value elimination. Dead value elimination is similar to the dead basic block
elimination, except that it works with values instead of basic blocks.
Unfortunately, the example in figure~\ref{fig:simplify-example} does not contain
any dead values. However, the idea is quite simple to understand. Most of the
dead values come from WebAssembly's \texttt{drop} instruction which discards
values from the implicit operand stack. In a non-SSA control flow graph, one
usually needs first to perform \emph{liveness analysis} and \emph{reaching
    definition analysis} to determine if the value is dead. But in SSA, one can
quickly recover this information from use-definition chain, and in SableWasm,
the base class \texttt{ASTNode} automatically manages it. Thus, the optimizer
will iterate over all values within the control flow graph and check if others
refer to it. If not, it then verifies if the instruction is \emph{droppable}.
A droppable instruction is an instruction such that if we remove it from the
control flow graphs, no observable effects should happen, similar to the
concept of `pure' for functions. Finally, if instructions are both dead and
droppable, the optimizer will remove them from the control flow graph.

In this section, we covered the flow graph simplification pass in SableWasm. The
optimizer will iteratively run four patterns that we have discussed above until
it reaches a fixed point. Figure~\ref{fig:simplify-result} shows the result of
running these optimizations on the input shown in
figure~\ref{fig:simplify-example}. Compared to the original, the result is more
readable. Moreover, by reducing the number of basic blocks, we can improve other
analyses in SableWasm.
