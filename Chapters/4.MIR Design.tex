\chapter{Middle-level Intermediate Representation}
\label{chapter:mir-design}

This chapter describes SableWasm's middle-level intermediate representation
(MIR), which has a critical role in the entire compilation pipeline. The MIR
acts as a middle ground between the WebAssembly bytecode frontend and various
possible backends. Currently, SableWasm only implements one backend that
utilizes the LLVM compilation framework, but adding more backend support should
not require significant modification on the MIR. It also implements an
analysis and transformation framework where we perform several optimizations
over the MIR. We will first go over the overall design of the MIR, and
later move to the translation rules and analysis framework in the
chapter~\ref{chapter:mir-translation-optimization}. \\[12pt]


In the previous chapters, we covered the design of WebAssembly bytecode. A quick
reminder, WebAssembly is a stack-based intermediate representation (IR) where
all instructions operate over an implicitly declared operand stack. There are
several advantages of a stack-based IR. Perhaps the most important one is its
portability. A stack-based IR makes fewer assumptions on the machine than a
register-based one. One can even provide an implementation for a hypothetical
device with only one register. Another advantage is the code size. Experiments
show that, in general, a stack-based IR is smaller in size than its
corresponding registered version \cite{stack-and-register-vm}. When designing a
binary format that ships executables over the internet, the stack-based IR seems
to be a better choice for WebAssembly.

Nevertheless, there are no silver bullets: a stack-based IR design also has its
drawbacks. One of them is the difficulty faced when performing code analysis and
transformation over the module. As for each instruction, its operands implicitly
come from the stack; the value use-definition relationship between instructions
is not apparent to the analysis, and recovering such connection between
instructions from the IR is not a trivial task.

\end{figure}

On the other hand, we have the register-based intermediate representation,
commonly abstracted to assume an infinite number of registers and requiring a
register allocation algorithm to map them to actual, physical registers. For
each instruction in register-based IR, it has its operand encoded in the
instruction. Hence, the use-definition relationship will become explicit to the
analysis and transformation.

The main design goal for SableWasm MIR is to provide an analysis platform for
the entire compiler system. Thus, we implement our MIR as an infinite register
machine. We also take a traditional approach in various other aspects. For
example, instead of using the structured control flow similar to what
WebAssembly offers, we use \emph{control-flow graphs} (CFGs) to represent the
relationship between basic blocks. The SableWasm MIR is also in
\emph{single static assignment} (SSA) form \cite{ibm-ssa}, as covered in the
background chapter. The design for instruction and module-level entities in
SableWasm MIR is quite similar to what WebAssembly instruction offers. One can
view the SableWasm MIR as a mixture of the target LLVM intermediate
representation and the source WebAssembly bytecode. We also adopt several design
features from LLVM IR into MIR, such as automatically managed use-site lists,
which provide each AST node with an efficient way to access their use sites.
In SableWasm MIR, all elements are derived from the base class \texttt{ASTNode}
which implements these features that are helpful later in MIR analysis and
transformation.

Figure~\ref{fig:mir-fibonacci} shows a simple function that calculates Fibonacci
numbers with a recursive method in SableWasm MIR. With the help of the figure,
we will go through the detailed design of SableWasm later in the chapter. We
will first present the module-level entity and their initializer
expressions, such as functions, then move to the design of each instruction
defined in MIR.
