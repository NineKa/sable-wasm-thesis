\chapter{Frontend}
\label{chapter:frontend}

This chapter describes the frontend of SableWasm. The frontend consists of two
parts, the bytecode parser and the validation pass. WebAssembly is a
continuously evolving language, and its community might add new instructions in
the future. Hence, the design of the parser and the bytecode validation phase
closely follows WebAssembly's specification and is modular to ensure the
framework's extensibility. Additional functionalities are provided via a
read-only view of the module structure. The design of the parser and the
validation phase focuses on performance, both in execution time and memory
footprint.

\section{Bytecode Parser}

One of WebAssembly's binary format design goals is to be simple to parse.
Although open-source bytecode parsing and validation libraries have become
available at this point, such as WABT \footnote{WebAssembly Binary Toolkit:
  \url{https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt.git}} provided by the WebAssembly
community, there was no suitable library at the time when the project starts.
Thus, for SableWasm, we implemented our bytecode parsing frontend instead. The
bytecode parser consists of three components: the byte-source reader,
WebAssembly bytecode parser and the parser delegate. This section will give a
brief description of each component, and figure~\ref{fig:sablewasm-parser}
presents a general illustration of the parser design.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Byte-source reader}
The byte-source reader consists of two parts, the byte-buffer reader and the
WebAssembly reader. The byte-buffer reader provides essential functionalities
such as reading and skipping ahead. Additionally, the byte-buffer reader also
needs to support rewind and enforce an end-of-stream barrier. Any out of bound
access, either beyond the barrier or if the byte stream is exhausted, will
signal via exceptions. On the other hand, the WebAssembly reader provides a
richer interface to the parser, such as the ability to decode LEB-128 encoded
integers and parse WebAssembly value types. The WebAssembly reader is also
responsible for validating the result before passing it to the parser. In the
case where the result is invalid, the reader throws exceptions similar to the
byte-buffer reader.

\paragraph{WebAssembly parser}
WebAssembly parser is the kernel part of the parsing framework. As we discussed
earlier in this chapter, one of the primary design goals of the framework is its
extensibility. Hence, the SableWasm parser is modular and consists of three
parts: the parser core, the custom section parser and the instruction extension
parser. The grammar for the WebAssembly binary representation is quite simple,
and therefore, the parser core implements a simple top-down recursive descent
parser with a single byte look-ahead.

\emph{Custom sections} are a special section defined in the WebAssembly
standard. They are essentially a binary data chunk tagged with a string name.
How to interpret the binary data can be different in each case. These custom
sections can either be standardized by the community or defined as specific to a
toolchain. In this project, we implement two custom sections standardized by the
WebAssembly working group, namely \emph{Name} section and \emph{Producer}
section. The \emph{Name} section gives human-readable names to functions and
their local variables that help with program debugging. The specification does
not require these names to be the same as the import or export names. There is
no direct support for more detailed debug information encoding in WebAssembly at
the time of thesis writing; however, extensions are working on this problem,
such as DWARF for WebAssembly \footnote{DWARF for WebAssembly:
  \url{https://yurydelendik.github.io/webassembly-dwarf/}}. The \emph{Producer}
section is relatively simple. It only encodes information about the toolchain
that generates the module, such as the toolchain name and version. All custom
section parsers in SableWasm are derived from the base class
\texttt{CustomSection}. The parser core will dispatch the binary chunk to the
corresponding custom section parser based on the name tag. Each custom section
parser manages its results and does not communicate to the parser delegate
directly.

Instruction extension parsers focus on another different aspect of the
WebAssembly module. In the background section, we have visited several
extensions that merged with the WebAssembly specification. A quick reminder,
WebAssembly extensions can insert or modify the instructions defined in the
minimum-viable-product (MVP) specification. The SableWasm WebAssembly parser
employs instruction extension parsers to address this problem. When the parser
intends to parse an instruction, it will iterate over all its instruction
extension parsers in a chained manner. If the instruction opcode is not
recognized by any registered instruction extension parser nor in the
minimum-viable-product specification, the parser will signal the error by
throwing an exception. An instruction extension parser can also override the
default behaviour for MVP instructions by handling instructions early,
though, in the current version of WebAssembly, no extensions modify the
semantics of these instructions. In this project, we implement two instruction
extension parsers, the non-trapping-float-to-int conversion parser and SIMD
parser, which handles the instructions introduced by the extensions as their
names suggest.

\paragraph{Parser delegate}
The last part of the SableWasm WebAssembly bytecode parser is the parser
delegate. The parser delegate and the parser core directly implement
the typical delegation pattern seen in many other projects, separating the
parsing logic from the heavy lifting of module construction. One can implement
a validation pass at this level without module construction. However, in this
project, we implement our bytecode validation pass after the module
construction, giving space for further projects focusing on bytecode-level
transformation. We will discuss the implementation of such a validation pass
later in the chapter.

In this section, we gave a brief overview of the parser framework introduced in
SableWasm. In the next section, we will discuss the WebAssembly bytecode
representation used in the project and several techniques to improve the
performance and ensure flexibility.

\section{WebAssembly Bytecode Representation}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/sablewasm-bytecode.pdf}
  \caption{SableWasm bytecode representation}
  \label{fig:sablewasm-bytecode}
\end{figure}

The WebAssembly specification provides compact representations in both binary
and text formats \cite{10.1145/3062341.3062363}, and might subject to change in
the future. In SableWasm, we implement our bytecode representation as close to
the specification as possible. Hence, in the future, if the community alters
the specification, we can straightforwardly update the bytecode representation
without introducing extra complexity. In figure~\ref{fig:sablewasm-bytecode},
we present an illustration of the bytecode representation used in SableWasm.
The WebAssembly bytecode representation in SableWasm consists of three layers:
the module, the entities, and the instructions, which we will discuss in detail
later in this section. Compared to the representation given in the WebAssembly
specification, the only difference we have is the \texttt{Function}. The
standard WebAssembly bytecode representation splits the function section into
two different sections, \emph{function} and \emph{code}, to achieve its
one-pass validation goal. The \emph{function} section contains the type of all
functions defined in the module, similar to function declarations in other
programming languages. Later in the module, the \emph{code} section defines
them. On the other hand, in SableWasm, we merge these two sections into a single
\texttt{Function} object. A \texttt{Function} in SableWasm bytecode
representation contains both its type and body definition.

\paragraph{WebAssembly module view}
The WebAssembly module structure only serves as a storage container for the
bytecode representation and itself does not provide an interface to the user,
except by retrieving entities by index. Additionally, the WebAssembly standard
binary format focuses more on compactness instead of usability, which leads to
complexity when retrieving the information. For example, to avoid duplication,
the function types are stored in their own section, namely, the \emph{type}
section. Later in the module, any reference to the type becomes indices within
this section. Another example is entity indices. The WebAssembly specification
requires that every import entry in the \emph{import} section implicitly
introduces an index in its corresponding class. These indices should come
before any definition introduced in the module. These two rules suggest that to
retrieve an entity by index, one should first iterate over all the imports and
then locate the entity accordingly, which is a relatively expansive operation.
To address these problems, we implement a read-only view of the WebAssembly
module that caches the indices and provides additional features.

\paragraph{Instructions}
SableWasm takes a traditional `abstract syntax tree' approach to bytecode
instruction representation. The frontend represents each instruction using a
corresponding class derived from a common base class, namely
\texttt{Instruction}, and an expression with a vector of instruction pointers.
One observation is that the heap memory usage grows rapidly, as each instruction
requires a unique heap-allocated object, which is not optimal. In WebAssembly,
instructions operate over an implicitly defined stack, and for most of the
operations, there are no operands attached to them. For example,
\texttt{F32x4Nearest} has no operand; it will pop a value from the stack, treat
it as a vector of packed single-precision floating-point values, round them to
the nearest integer, and finally push the result back to the stack. From the
bytecode representation point of view, there is no difference between multiple
instances of the same instruction. Hence, we use pointers that point to object
singletons to represent instructions without operands to reduce memory
consumption. However, this introduces a problem in distinguishing a pointer that
points to an object from one referring to an actual heap-allocated object which
requires memory deallocation. To address this problem, we use tagged pointers.
For a non-heap allocated singleton object, we tag the least significant bit in
the pointer with zero; and on the other hand, we tag that of a heap-allocated
object pointer with one. Later, we only need to examine the pointer's least
significant bit within the destructor and deallocate memory when needed. With
tagged pointer techniques, we can significantly reduce the memory needed to
store the bytecode representations while maintaining their polymorphic nature.
As less memory allocation is needed, we also observe performance improvement in
terms of execution time, which we will later see in this chapter.

This section gave an overview of the bytecode representation used in SableWasm
and several techniques to improve its performance. In the next section, we will
move to the validation pass implementation in SableWasm.

\section{WebAssembly Bytecode Validation}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/sablewasm-validation.pdf}
  \caption{SableWasm validation pass}
  \label{fig:sablewasm-validation}
\end{figure}

The WebAssembly specification defines detailed static validation rules both for
well-formedness and type-soundness. Similar to the parser framework, we
implement our validation pass as close to the specification as possible. If
there are changes to the specification in the future, we can adopt them with
minimal effort. The validation pass implementation consists of three parts:
the validation context, the validation visitor, and the trace collector as
illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:sablewasm-validation}. Later in the section,
we will give a brief introduction to each of the components. The detailed
validation rule, both well-formedness and type-soundness, are listed in the
WebAssembly introduction paper \cite{10.1145/3062341.3062363}, and a separate
paper that focuses on validation \cite{10.1145/3167082}. Note that these two
papers only present the validation rules for the minimum viable product (MVP)
WebAssembly and each extension may modify the specification. The additional
validation rules introduced by the extensions adopted by SableWasm are
relatively trivial. Hence, we will not give a detailed description here, and one
should consult the extension proposals for detailed information.

\paragraph{Validation context}
The validation context implements the context defined in the WebAssembly
specification. It provides an easy way for the validation visitor to access the
WebAssembly entities' declarations. The validation context itself does not
perform any error signalling. The validation context also manages the operand
stack and the label stack. The operand stack stores the type information
gathered from the instruction within the expression while the label stack keeps
track of the signatures of the control flow structures. The operand stack also
records the requirements generated from type variable sequences and checks if
there are contradictions among them.

\paragraph{Validation visitor}
The validation visitor is the core driver part of the validation pass. It
implements all the validation rules for each instruction and derives from the
visitor template. In the current state of implementation, the design of the
validation visitor is not modular, and hence, if additional instructions are
added to the project later, direct modification is required. The validation
visitor also handles all the error signalling. However, it does not construct
the error objects by itself. The task is deferred to the trace collector. For
most of the instructions, the validation rule is quite simple, involves only
popping and pushing values to the operand stack. Currently, the validation
visitor will stop at the first error it encounters due to the WebAssembly
validation rules' design.

\paragraph{Trace collector}
The last part of the validation pass implementation is the trace collector. It
locates the position of the instruction that currently undergoes validation. It
first keeps track of the section where the instruction lives with an enumeration
and uses a stack to track how to locate it. Every time the validation visitor
enters a nested construct such as \texttt{if}, \texttt{block} or \texttt{loop},
it pushes the construct to the site stack and pops when a nested expression
finishes validation. If the validation visitor locates an error, the trace
collector will build the error by moving the trace stack into the error object.

In this section, we presented the validation pass implementation in SableWasm.
In the next section, we will perform some experiments to evaluate the system's
performance in terms of both execution speed and memory footprint.

\section{Performance Evaluation}

This section presents the performance benchmark comparison between the SableWasm
parser frontend and the WebAssembly binary toolkit (WABT) offered by the
WebAssembly community group. The benchmarks focus on both the execution time and
memory footprint. We will first present the benchmark setup and then evaluate
the data collected from the experiment.

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Frontend memory footprint comparison}
  \label{fig:sablewasm-eval-memory}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Benchmark setup}
Experiments were performed on a server with a six-core Intel Core processor at
3.7 GHz standard clock frequency and an L3 cache of 12MiB. The server runs
Ubuntu 18.04 with Linux kernel version 4.15.0 and 32GiB of memory. For the
benchmark subject, we choose Pyodide \footnote{Pyodide project:
  \url{https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide}}, a WebAssembly implementation of
Python 3.8. The project has reasonable complexity, and the size of the module is
quite significant, which reduces the measurement errors during the benchmark.
The WebAssembly binary toolkit (WABT) we used during the benchmark is version
1.0.23, and we perform module validation with its \texttt{wasm-validate}
command. This command should parse the WebAssembly module, construct an internal
bytecode representation, and finally perform a validation pass over it. This
procedure is similar to what we used in the SableWasm frontend. For the
execution speed experiment, we time the execution speed with the shell builtin
\texttt{time} command. We perform ten runs for each implementation in total and
then compute the average execution speed. For memory footprint, we use the
Massif tool provided by Valgrind \cite{valgrind-paper}. Massif is a heap
profiler that collects heap memory usage throughout a program lifetime, which we
will use to compare two implementations.

\paragraph{Benchmark result}
We will go over the finding over the execution speed first and then analyze the
memory footprint. Table~\ref{tab:frontend-benmark-time} gives the result of the
execution speed benchmark. The data is relatively consistent over a total of ten
runs, where the SableWasm frontend achieves around 1.5x to 1.7x speedup compared
to \texttt{wasm-validated} provided by WABT. On average, the SableWasm frontend
is 1.6x times faster than WABT's implementation.

\input{Tables/sablewasm-parser-benchmark}

On the topic of memory footprint,
figure~\ref{fig:sablewasm-eval-memory-sablewasm} and
figure~\ref{fig:sablewasm-eval-memory-wabt} shows the memory consumption trace
for SableWasm and WABT, respectively. As we can see from the figures, SableWasm
consumes approximately 108MiB at peak while WABT uses around 506MiB, suggesting
a 4.6x reduction in memory footprint. More specifically, SableWasm spends about
38MiB for bytecode representation, and WABT takes roughly 64MiB, indicating a
1.7x reduction for bytecode representation only. Note that in SableWasm's heap
memory trace, we can accurately determine the memory consumption of bytecode
representation using debug symbols. However, this is not the case for WABT,
where the debug information is stripped from the executable. In this experiment,
we estimate the memory consumption for bytecode representation via the vector
that contains the opcode.

Overall the SableWasm frontend implementation performs better than WABT in
terms of both execution speed and memory footprint. Of course, SableWasm is a
static compiler that will only perform parsing and validation at compile-time
and does not affect the overall execution time for emitted executables. However,
in the future, if one would like to implement a just-in-time (JIT) style
compiler, the SableWasm parsing and validation frontend can effectively improve
the response time of the JIT compiler.

We visited the design and implementation of the SableWasm frontend, which takes
care of parsing, validating and constructing a bytecode representation in this
chapter. In the next chapter, we will move to the next phase in the SableWasm
compilation pipeline, the middle-level intermediate representation.
