\section{Interface with C/C++}
\label{section:runtime-host-lang}

The last section of this chapter will cover the interface between the generated
shared library and the host languages. Currently, SableWasm only has a binder
library for C/C++. However, the principle is relatively straightforward, and
one can add implementations of the binder function for any other language. In
the rest of the section, we will focus our discussion on the callee wrapper,
WASI function implementations and error handling strategies.

\paragraph{Callee wrapper}
Section~\ref{section:runtime-instance-layout} mentioned that SableWasm stores a
function instance as a pair of
context pointer and function address pointer. Additionally, SableWasm also
encodes the function types as null-terminated strings. However, all this
information is only available to the host program at runtime. C/C++ is a
statically typed language; hence, we can only specify type contracts on the
exported functions at compile-time and verify the contracts at runtime.
Traditionally, one can use a type erased pointer, a \texttt{void} pointer,
to store the function address and reinterpret it to the actual concrete type.
SableWasm presents a helper class that provides type-safe access to the
exported functions: \texttt{WebAssemblyCallee}. \texttt{WebAssemblyCallee} takes
advantage of the template metaprogramming system in C++ and generates
a null-terminated encoding of an expected type at compile-time. At runtime,
the wrapper class will check the type signature string against the actual type
string before forwarding the function call. If the type signature string does
not match, the system will signal an exception.

\paragraph{WASI interface implementation}
WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extends WebAssembly by providing syscalls
that interact with the host environment. This extension is non-invasive, and
all the syscalls are in the form of imported functions, mainly host
functions. Hence, SableWasm implements the WASI extension using host library
functions only. At the shared library initialization phase, the loader will set
up WASI host functions based on the import descriptor. Currently, SableWasm only
implements the minimal WASI interface functions necessary in order to run
benchmarks, such as standard I/O and timing. However, the framework is easy to
extend, and all the WASI function implementations are under the namespace
\texttt{runtime::wasi}. Therefore, we will skip them in detail in the thesis;
one can consult the source code for implementation details of WASI interface
functions. One of the project's future work is to continuously work on the
WASI system interface and add more features to SableWasm, such as
capability-based file system and networking.

\paragraph{Error handling strategies}
The last topic we will address in the section is error handling. SableWasm
builds its error handling strategy based on the C++ exception mechanism.
Comparing to other exception handling strategies, this brings us two
significant benefits. First, when generating LLVM intermediate representation
for shared libraries, we can avoid boilerplate code that propagates exceptions.
Additionally, on most modern system ABIs that supports zero-cost exception
handling, this gives SableWasm a performance advantage. On the other hand, this
leaves us room for further improvement for pending WebAssembly extensions, such
as the WebAssembly exception handling extension \footnote{WebAssembly exception
    handling: \url{https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling}}.
The WebAssembly exception handling extension generalizes the WebAssembly
specification by adding \texttt{try catch} construct to the syntax, which
directly corresponds to the C++ exception handling mechanism.

In this section, we discussed the interaction between C/C++ and the SableWasm
system. We will conclude the chapter with a concrete loader function example.
Figure~\ref{fig:sablewasm-loader} demonstrates a simple loader function for
generated SableWasm shared libraries. In the example above, we assume the
WebAssembly module is a WASI compatible module, and hence, exports a function
named \texttt{\_start} as the entry function with type \texttt{[] -> []}.
