\section{Code Generation}
\label{section:runtime-codegen}

This section describes the code generation strategy used in the SableWasm LLVM
backend. For most of the instructions, especially for SableWasm MIR numeric
operations, the translation rules are simple mappings between SableWasm MIR
instructions and their LLVM counterparts. In this section, we will skip the
discussion over these trivial mapping. Instead, one can consult the SableWasm
source code for more details. The rest of the section will focus on several
key aspects: local variable implementation, linear memory manipulation,
indirect function calls, and SIMD instruction operations. One problem that
arises when lowering SableWasm MIR into LLVM intermediate representation is
how to pick the instruction translation order. Any instruction in SableWasm MIR
can refer to values either generated by a previous instruction in the same basic
block or instructions within a dominating block, implying that when lowering
SableWasm MIR, we need to perform a pre-order tree traversal over the dominator
tree. However, $\phi$ nodes may exist merging candidate values from prior
dominating blocks or due to subsequent backward branching.
Hence, the translation visitor may not have translated the candidate value
before $\phi$ nodes. SableWasm backend takes a two-phase translation to address
this problem. In the first pass, the backend will translate all the instructions
and collect the resulting values into a map, and in the second pass, the backend
will come back to the $\phi$ nodes and fix up the candidate values accordingly.

\paragraph{Function declaration and local variables} \quad
\begin{lstlisting}[
  basicstyle=\linespread{1}\small\ttfamily, 
  language=LLVM, 
  mathescape=true]
function %foo: [i32] -> [f32] {
  {(arg) %local0: i32, %local1: f64} 
  ......
}
$\Longrightarrow$
define private float @foo(%__sable_instance_t* %0, i32 %1) {
entry:
  %2 = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %1, i32* %2, align 4
  %3 = alloca double, align 8
  store double 0.000000e+00, double* %3, align 8
  ......
}

{%local: i32} 
%t0 = local.get %local $\Longrightarrow$ %t0 = load i32, i32* %local, align 4
local.set %local %t0 $\Longrightarrow$ store i32 %t0, i32* %local, align 4
\end{lstlisting}

We will first start by examining the translation pattern for lowering SableWasm
MIR functions into LLVM functions and their local variables. The example above
presents a simple function named \texttt{foo}, which takes a single 32-bit
integer as the argument and returns a single-precision floating-pointer number.
\texttt{foo} has two local variables. The parameter implicitly introduces the
first one, \texttt{local0}, and the function explicitly defines the second one,
\texttt{local1}. At runtime, \texttt{local0} will hold the value of the
parameter upon entry, and \texttt{local1} will initialize to zero. Compared to
the SableWasm MIR function definition, the one in LLVM intermediate
representation (IR) has three major differences. First, the LLVM function
definition has the extra instance object pointer in the arguments, in the
example above, \texttt{\%0}. We covered this briefly in the instance layout
section. In short, for all the functions, the SableWasm backend code generator
will implicitly add the instance object pointer as the first argument. The
second difference is in the entry block. SableWasm MIR, similar to WebAssembly,
views the local variables as opaque memory slots. However, LLVM IR requires
users to manually allocate them in stack memory space via the \texttt{alloca}
instruction. The \texttt{alloca} instruction reserves enough memory on the
stack based on the given type and returns a pointer. In example above,
\texttt{\%2} and \texttt{\%3} are two reserved local variable memory region
that correspond to \texttt{local0} and \texttt{local1} accordingly. The last
difference is that SableWasm IR defines implicit initialization for all local
variables; on the other hand, LLVM \texttt{alloca} instruction leaves the
reserved memory with uninitialized values. Hence, to faithfully implement
WebAssembly and SableWasm MIR specification, we generate \texttt{store}
instructions to set the initial values for each local variables. As for
\texttt{LocalGet} and \texttt{LocalSet} instructions, the translation patterns
are quite straightforward. The SableWasm backend code generator maps
\texttt{LocalGet} instructions to \texttt{load} instructions and
\texttt{LocalSet} instructions to \texttt{store} instructions as demonstrated
in the example above.

\paragraph{Linear memory operation} \quad
\begin{lstlisting}[
  basicstyle=\linespread{1}\small\ttfamily, 
  language=LLVM, 
  mathescape=true]
$\text{\textbf{Fetching linear memory:}}$
%t0     = getelementptr 
            inbounds %__sable_instance_t, %__sable_instance_t* %0, 
            i32 0, i32 4
%memory = load %__sable_memory_t*, %__sable_memory_t** %t0, align 8

%t0 = memory.size %mem $\Longrightarrow$
%t0 = call i32 @__sable_memory_size(%__sable_memory_t* %mem)
%t0 = memory.grow %mem %delta $\Longrightarrow$
%t0 = call i32 @__sable_memory_grow(%__sable_memory_t* %mem, i32 %delta)
memory.guard %mem %offset $\Longrightarrow$
call void @__sable_memory_guard(%__sable_memory_t* %mem, i32 %offset)
\end{lstlisting}
In section~\ref{section:runtime-instance-layout} and
\ref{section:runtime-webassembly-entities}, we presented how the
instance object manages the linear
memory instance and several runtime functions that implement additional
functionalities. The SableWasm backend code generator takes advantage of the
design by mapping SableWasm linear memory manipulation instructions into builtin
function invocations. The example above demonstrates the mapping for
\texttt{MemorySize}, \texttt{MemoryGrow} and \texttt{MemoryGuard} instructions.
All these instructions map to \texttt{call} instructions to their corresponding
builtin functions with appropriate arguments. Note that all builtin functions
require passing the linear memory pointer as an argument. Currently, the
WebAssembly module can have at most one linear memory. Due to the validation
rules, such linear memory must present within the module if linear memory
manipulation instructions appear in the program. Further, as we store linear
memory instance pointers before any other entities, one can show that the
linear pointer must be the 5th pointer in the instance object. Hence, the
SableWasm backend code generator fetches the linear memory instance pointer
using a pair of a \texttt{getelementptr} instruction and a \texttt{load}
instruction. The \texttt{getelementptr} instruction LLVM calculate addresses
for entries in a aggregation. The above example calculates addresses base on
the type \texttt{\_\_sable\_instance\_t} which is generated according to
declared entities at compile time.

\paragraph{Linear memory load and store} \quad
\begin{lstlisting}[
  basicstyle=\linespread{1}\small\ttfamily, 
  language=LLVM, 
  mathescape=true]
$\text{\textbf{Load a 32-bit integer:}}$
%result = load.32 i32 %mem %addr $\Longrightarrow$
  %t0     = ptrtoint %__sable_memory_t* %memory to i64
  %t1     = zext i32 %offset to i64
  %t2     = add nuw i64 %t0, %t1
  %addr   = inttoptr i64 %t2 to i32*
  %result = load i32, i32* %addr, align 1
$\text{\textbf{Partial load a 32-bit integer:}}$
%result = load.16 i32 %mem %addr $\Longrightarrow$
  ......
  %t0     = load i16, i16* %addr, align 1
  %result = zext i16 %t0 to i32
$\text{\textbf{Store a 32-bit integer:}}$
store.32 %mem %addr %val $\Longrightarrow$
  ......
  store i32 %val, i32* %addr, align 1
$\text{\textbf{Partial store a 32-bit integer:}}$
store.16 %mem %addr %val $\Longrightarrow$
  ...... 
  %t0    = trunc i32 %val to i16
  store i16 %t0, i16* %addr, align 1
\end{lstlisting}
SableWasm MIR classifies load and store instructions into two groups,
partial and complete. A quick reminder, WebAssembly associates load and store
operations with sign extension mode, while in SableWasm, we define load
instruction to perform zero extension, and store instructions always apply bit
truncation. The first example above presents a complete load operation for a
32-bit integer. The translation pattern is relatively straightforward. Note
that the linear memory instance pointer points to the first byte within the
linear memory. Hence, the SableWasm backend code generator will first calculate
the native write address by summing up offset and base pointer and map the
\texttt{Load} instruction to \texttt{load} in LLVM. The LLVM memory operation,
such as \texttt{load} and \texttt{store} has a complementary attribute,
\texttt{align}. In the background section, we introduced the attributes in
LLVM. In short, the \texttt{align} attribute marks an alignment requirement for
memory access operations. As WebAssembly linear memory is comparable to a byte
array, in which read-write can occur at any point, we can only conservatively
set the alignment to one in order to limit the LLVM backend instruction selector
from generating instructions with alignment assumptions. This, in theory, leads
to less efficient code. However, later in the evaluation section, we determine
this is not a bottleneck of the entire implementation. In the future, one can
further improve the performance of SableWasm by designing analyses that infer
lower bounds for alignment. The second example above demonstrates the
translation pattern for partial load operation. Compared to the complete load
instruction, the translation pattern for partial load instruction has an
additional zero-extending operation, \texttt{zext} at the bottom, to implement
the SableWasm MIR partial load semantics. On the other hand, the translation
pattern for both complete and partial \texttt{store} instructions are very
similar to \texttt{load} instructions. The most notable difference is the
\texttt{trunc} instruction in partial \texttt{store}'s translation pattern
which performs bit truncation on the operand.

\paragraph{Indirect function call} \quad
\begin{lstlisting}[
  basicstyle=\linespread{1}\small\ttfamily, 
  language=LLVM, 
  mathescape=true]
call.indirect %table %index %expect_ty $\Longrightarrow$ 
  call void @__sable_table_guard(%__sable_table_t* %table, i32 %index)
  call void @__sable_table_check(
    %__sable_table_t* %table, i32 %index, i8* %expect_ty)
  %t0 = call %__sable_instance_t* @__sable_table_context(
    %__sable_table_t* %table, i32 %index)
  %t1 = call %__sable_function_t* @__sable_table_function(
    %__sable_table_t* %table, i32 %index)
  %t2 = icmp eq %__sable_instance_t* %t0, null
  %t3 = select i1 %t2, %__sable_instance_t* %0, %__sable_instance_t* %t0
  %t4 = bitcast %__sable_function_t* %276 to ......
  %t5 = call ...... %t4(%__sable_instance_t* %t3, ......)
\end{lstlisting}
The SableWasm backend code generator implements indirect function calls via a
series of builtin function invocations. We have already presented the builtin
function in section~\ref{section:runtime-webassembly-entities}; hence, we will
not show them in detail in this
paragraph. The first step for calling an indirect function is to check if the
index is within range by calling the \texttt{\_\_sable\_table\_guard} builtin
function. If the index is within range, we then compare the expected function
type with the actual indirect function type with
\texttt{\_\_sable\_table\_check}. Note that this builtin function also checks
if the entry is a null function. If so, it will report an exception. The
SableWasm backend code generator uses a similar technique to encode the
expected function type into a null-terminated string, as we have seen in
section~\ref{section:runtime-instance-layout}. After we make sure the indirect
function is valid, we can now
fetch the context pointer and function address pointer by using two getter
functions, \texttt{\_\_sable\_table\_context} and
\texttt{\_\_sable\_table\_function}. Before we invoke the function, we need to
check if it is a host function. A quick reminder, SableWasm will set context
pointers for all host functions as null pointers, and when invoking a host
function, we need to pass the current instance object pointer as the context
pointer. The SableWasm code generator chooses the correct context pointer by
using a pair of \texttt{icmp} and \texttt{select} instruction. After selecting
the correct context pointer, the indirect function is straightforward by
casting the function code address into the function pointer and invoking it
appropriately. One may notice that the indirect function call in SableWasm is
costly and involves multiple function calls. WebAssembly specification does not
impose requirements on indirect function call efficiency, and later in our
benchmark, we determine that indirect function calls are not a performance
bottleneck. Hence, the SableWasm code generator focus on extensibility rather
than performance.

\paragraph{SIMD operation}
The last translation pattern we will cover in the section is the SIMD
operations. For most of the SIMD operations, the SableWasm backend code
generator maps to their LLVM counterparts. However, one challenge arises when
translating SableWasm MIR into LLVM intermediate representation around the
type system. In section~\ref{section:mir-opt-type-inference}, we presented the
type system for SableWasm MIR.
A quick reminder, the SableWasm MIR follows WebAssembly's design by erasing the
shape information from the vector values, depending on instructions to
interpret them correctly. However, LLVM intermediate representation does
require shape information for vectors. Hence, when lowering SableWasm MIR into
the LLVM intermediate representation, the SableWasm backend code generator needs
to insert cast instructions when required. For most of the numerical
instructions, this is pretty trivial. The backend code generator will first
infer an LLVM vector type based on the SableWasm instruction shape information.
For example, \texttt{v128.add i16x4} implies that the operand must have type
\texttt{<4 x i16>} in LLVM. In the case where the shape type is unsuitable,
the SableWasm backend code generator will insert a bit cast,
\texttt{bitcast to}. The bit cast operation is always valid as, in the current
version of SableWasm MIR, we only work with 128-bit vectors. However, there
are still several corner cases in this strategy. What type should we assign to
$\phi$ nodes when merging vectors from multiple control-flow? Also, what type
should we assign for load instruction when shape information is still not yet
available? The SableWasm backend code generator takes advantage of the fact
that integer types in LLVM can be arbitrarily long, and more specifically,
128-bit integer, \texttt{i128}, is a valid type in LLVM. The SableWasm backend
code generator will always use \texttt{i128} as a default type in these corner
cases. For example, for load instruction for SableWasm vectors, the code
generator will emit a \texttt{load} instruction with \texttt{i128} type, and
later when any instruction takes the value as the operand, it will setup the
bit cast instruction accordingly.
